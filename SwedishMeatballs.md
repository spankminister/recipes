## Swedish Meatballs

This recipe is nominally based on [the FoodWishes version](https://foodwishes.blogspot.com/2012/11/swedish-meatballs-and-most-under.html) with a few of my own tweaks.

1.5-2 lbs ground pork
1/2   cup bread crumbs
1/2   cup milk
1     tbsp garlic powder
3     tbsp butter
3     tbsp flour
3-4   cups low sodium beef broth
2     tsp beef Better than Boullion or boullion cubes
1/2   cup heavy cream
1     egg

Preheat oven to 400F.

First, soak the bread crumbs in the milk in a bowl. In a separate bowl, put the pork and season with salt, pepper, and the garlic powder. Once the bread crumbs have absorbed the milk, combine with the meat and mash by hand until the mixture is slightly wetter than what you'd use for hamburger. Form into golf ball sized meatballs and place on a GREASED foil on a cookie sheet. Bake in the oven 20 minutes while you make the gravy.
